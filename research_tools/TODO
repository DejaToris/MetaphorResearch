dataset mockups:
- common objects per verb
- synonymous verbs per verb
- abstraction value per word

main algorithm:
for input VERB:
    L1 = common abstract objects of VERB
    L2 = concrete synonyms of VERB
        L2.i = common abstract objects of L2[i]

    sort L1 by item_prototypicality:
        for noun in L1:
            item_prototypicality = ranking_function(L1 rank, L2 ranks)
    return L1
